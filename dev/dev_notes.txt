---ToDo List
1- Work on enumeration/"loot" functions
    -> http://g0tmi1k.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation.html
    -> http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/unix-privesc-check
2- Update
    -> Via git itself (git pull)
    -> http://blog.hackthology.com/how-to-write-self-updating-python-programs-us
    -> wget https://github.com/lnxg33k/webhandler/zipball/master -O /tmp/webhandler.zip && unzip /tmp/webhandler.zip -d /tmp/webhandler && mv -f /tmp/webhandler/lnxg33k-webhandler-*/* ./ && rm -rf /tmp/webhandler{/,zip}
    -> Version? Display on menu?
3- "stealth"/"encode" communication:
    -> export HISTFILE=/dev/null
    -> *cough*base64*cough*
4- Windows support
    -> Client (powershell)
    -> Server (Commands)
    -> Update (git)
5- Update screenshot/README
    -> Still says iCommand!
6- Backdoor
    -> Create a while loop to forever connect back to attacker (every 5 mins?)
7- Multiple sessions
    -> ...Like Metasploit
    -> Able to handle 'reverse' connections too (e.g. an alternative netcat)

---> Image sums it up well. If there is any text on the injection page - it causes errors in the handler. An idea to fix it? Have a uniq sig, which is displayed before the command, and then grep for it

->bug05.png
---> Running the backdoor command twice in a row, causes webhandler to crash.


---Notes
* g0tmi1k: Had to call it a day, working on update feature. Free feel to try and fix it ;)
* g0tmi1k: All "our" commands, have a "@" in-front, then all "local" commands have "!" in-front, then "normal" is "normal" on attacker?
* g0tmi1k: Tested a few backdoors methonds out - need to finish testing the rest ASAP
